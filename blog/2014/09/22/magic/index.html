<div class="entry-content"><p>When people who program want to convey to others the joy and satisfaction we
find in our craft, we often liken it to doing magic. The analogy evokes a sense
of empowerment, possibility and freedom. But I think comparing programming to
magic actually does unintended harm, because it has another connotation: that
programming is a mystical ability, something you are born with, not something
you can learn.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/evaysucamara/5438832695"><img src="/images/magic/magician.jpg" alt="Magician" /></a></p>

<p>I want to get a lot more people programming, and I think we need a better
analogy to get there.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h1 id="yer-a-wizard-harry">Yer a wizard, Harry</h1>

<p>People compare programming to magic with the best of intentions. In a heartfelt
and inspiring <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zW63dcZB0">keynote</a> at
<a href="https://thestrangeloop.com">Strange Loop</a> on the importance of sharing the joy
that programming brings us, <a href="https://twitter.com/gigasquid">Carin Meier</a>
likened programming to dreams of flying. A Kickstarter project
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thoughtstem/codespells-express-yourself-with-magic">CodeSpells</a>
offers to let you “express yourself with magic”. Fred Brooks wrote that the
programmer “builds castles in the air”.</p>

<p>As a way to inspire more people to learn to program, this seems to make
sense. Our popular culture is full of magical powers we would all love
to have access to: Harry Potter rides a broomstick and fights evil,
Gandalf summons giant eagles to get him out of harm’s way, Wolverine can
heal from any injury. (Of course, the “mutations” of the X-Men and “The
Force” in Star Wars are magic by another name.) Why wouldn’t anyone want
to learn something that gave them magical powers?</p>

<p>Here’s the problem: it’s almost always a special group of people who
have the magic. Harry Potter learns early on that he is a wizard, and
that most other people are not wizards. Gandalf never teaches Frodo any
spells. The X-Men have powers because of their mutations - they were
just born that way.</p>

<p>When we tell a non-programmer, who has watched <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Lord of the
Rings</em>, that programming is like magic, he’s likely to respond: “that sounds
great; I wish <em>I</em> could do it”. Most people already have little
concept of
<a href="/blog/2014/05/01/what-programming-is-like/">what programming is like</a>. Telling
him programming is like magic confirms what he probably already suspected:
programming is complicated and mysterious; it’s not for him.</p>

<h1 id="the-man-behind-the-curtain">The man behind the curtain</h1>

<p>Comparing programming to magic gives people some idea of why it’s <em>fun</em>,
but no idea of what it <em>is</em> - or how to learn it. Claiming to be
wizards, we are more like the Wizard of Oz - hiding behind a curtain of
mystique, magnifying our achievements to impress others. If we want
everyone to have access to this power, we need to pull back the curtain.</p>

<p>Programmers aren’t wizards. We’re just people, pulling levers to operate
the machine. We learned to program the same way we learned to cook or
ride a bike - by trying and failing, changing something and getting a
different response, and enjoying it enough to keep going. We need to
show what that process looks like, and how anyone with access to a
computer can do it.</p>

<p>Programming isn’t magic. It’s building a machine that talks to another
machine that moves data around, or makes pixels change colour, or makes
a speaker cone vibrate. We need to show how to do those things, and how
they add up to produce results that <em>feel</em> like magic.</p>

<h1 id="robot-dance-party">Robot dance party</h1>

<p>That brings me back to the Strange Loop keynote. After Meier’s
presentation, she was joined by two live-coding DJs,
<a href="https://twitter.com/samaaron">Sam Aaron</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/graham_jp">Jonathan Graham</a>. While they built up a
soundtrack from samples and loops, Meier set up a menagerie of robots,
including a quadcopter, and wrote a quick program to control the robots. Watch
the part <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zW63dcZB0&amp;t=40m30s">at 40:30</a> where
she gets the quadcopter dancing to the beat.</p>

<p>Let’s go over that again. Three programmers, with a live audience, <em>made
a flying robot dance to music they created</em>. If that’s not a magical
<em>result</em>, I don’t know what is.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t magic. Meier controlled the robots by sending
<a href="http://nodebots.io/">a few simple commands</a> to their motors. Aaron and Graham
produced the music with a screenful of code, using the
<a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a> toolkit. Using a
<a href="http://sonic-pi.net/">simplified version</a> of Overtone, Aaron has successfully
taught 12-year-olds to make music using code.</p>

<h1 id="programming-as-a-musical-instrument">Programming as a musical instrument</h1>

<p>The kids in Aaron’s class learned how to play a sample, change the pitch
to make a melody, loop it to make a backing track. They learned how to
build up several tracks into an ensemble, and how to tweak the music
until it sounded good. They learned all this in much less time than they
would have needed to learn a real musical instrument, or at least
produce any kind of pleasant sounds from it.</p>

<p>Of course, they were also learning programming: how to build up complex
systems from simple units, how to debug by changing parameters and
observing the change in output. But as far as they were concerned, they
were making music.</p>

<p>So if we want the rest of the world to have magical powers too, maybe
instead of comparing programming to magic, we should compare it to
<em>music</em>. Programming is like a musical instrument. A beginner can play
simple tunes, and as they grow more adept, they can add chords,
harmonies, counterpoint. Not everyone can write a symphony. But we can
all make robots dance.</p>

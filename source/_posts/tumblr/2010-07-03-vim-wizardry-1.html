<p>(I wrote this as a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1485009">response</a> to an Ask Hacker News <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1484061">post about learning Vim</a>, but I thought it deserved a life of its own.)</p>

<p>This is one of my favourite Vim features.  Say you have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>do_something_with(some + long * complicated * expression)
                           ^
</code></pre>

<p>Say your cursor is where the caret indicates.  Typing <code>ci)</code> (&#8220;change inside parens&#8221;) in normal mode will:</p>

<ul><li><p>delete all the text between the two matching parens</p></li>
<li><p>place you in insert mode with the cursor between the two (now adjacent) parens</p></li>
<li><p>put the deleted text in the yank buffer so that <code>p</code> will paste it.</p></li>
</ul><p>The use case here is obviously so you can assign a name to that long complicated expression.  <code>ci)</code> is much easier than selecting it with the mouse, and keeps your hands on the keyboard where they belong ;)</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>With nested parentheses, it does what you expect (affects the text contained by the innermost matching pair to contain your cursor - try it and see).</p>

<p>Other equally useful variants:</p>

<ul><li><p><code>i"</code> - &#8220;inside double quotes&#8221; - everything between double quotes</p></li>
<li><p><code>i'</code> - &#8220;inside single quotes&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p><code>iw</code> - &#8220;inside word&#8221; - the word the cursor is on</p></li>
<li><p><code>is</code> - &#8220;inside sentence&#8221; - great for editing prose</p></li>
<li><p><code>ip</code> - &#8220;inside paragraph&#8221;</p></li>
</ul><p>There are also similar motions beginning with &#8220;a&#8221;:</p>

<ul><li><p><code>a)</code> - like <code>i)</code> but includes the parens (e.g. <code>da)</code> deletes everything inside parens and the parens themselves)</p></li>
<li><p><code>a"</code> - similarly</p></li>
<li><p><code>aw</code> - like <code>iw</code> but includes trailing whitespace.</p></li>
</ul><p>For another great taste that goes great with this, see the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697">surround.vim</a> plugin.  To whet your appetite: six keystrokes to wrap your current selection in &lt;div&gt; tags; four to change a string from &#8220;double-quoted&#8221; to &#8216;single-quoted&#8217;.</p>

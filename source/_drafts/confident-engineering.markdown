*TODO* begin with an analogy about sports or martial arts or something

A lot of debates in software engineering get framed as a tradeoff between "quality" and "speed":

> * We're a startup, so we don't have time for testing and code review, or
>   we'll miss the market window.
> * The feature works 80% of the time, but we can't show it to users until we
>   know it won't break.
> * We have too many production issues and we're losing revenue - we need to
>   slow down and be more careful.
> * How can you justify spending a whole month on this refactoring when
>   customers won't even know you did it?
> * We can fix the scaling issues next month, after we ship this important
>   feature.

These debates usually become factional - technology vs business, or "hackers" vs "engineers" - and even ideological - "doing it fast" vs "doing it right", "pragmatism" vs "idealism".  Sometimes the idealists "win", and the team builds a rock-solid product that nobody buys.  Sometimes the pragmatists "win", and the team initially succeeds, then grinds to a halt fixing bugs and struggling to add new features.  Whichever faction wins, the losing side feels disenfranchised.

**TODO** say something about time horizons.  By the time each discussion is had, "fast" is almost always better than "right" - but add that up and you drown in technical debt.

A successful software team finds a way to balance quality and speed.  It chooses which corners to cut, and how many; which practices will get in its way and which will speed it up.  A successful team evaluates the fastest way, and the best way, and chooses the right parts of each.

How can we make these decisions?  I think the answer is to frame them differently.  Regardless of company size or stage, a lone hacker or a hundred-strong open source project, **TODO**
